## What Is Wallet Street Cousin?

$WSC is a pure meme coin on the **Flare Mainnet**, sparked by a typo in official Flare communications ‚Äî "Wallet Street Cousin" instead of "Wall Street."

The community ran with it. The meme became the message.

No utility. No roadmap promises. No tax. No developer games.  
Just 8.23 billion cousins and a reason to laugh.
