## What Is Wallet Street Cousin?

$WSC is a pure meme coin on the **Flare Mainnet**, sparked by a typo in official Flare communications ‚Äî "Wallet Street Cousin" instead of "Wall Street."

No utility. No roadmap promises. No tax. No developer games.  
Just 8.23 billion cousins and a reason to laugh.
