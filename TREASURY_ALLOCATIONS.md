# $WSC Treasury Allocation

The Treasury holds **35% of the total $WSC supply** and is managed publicly via the [`Treasury Wallet`](./WALLETS.md).

12.5% of total supply pledged to Liquidity Monsoon

**Remaining Funds to be put into 36 individual escrow contracts ala 'Ripple Escrow' unused funds will be re-escrowed into another 36 months contract**

These funds are reserved for ecosystem support, community growth, listings, and all the weird and wonderful things cousins may need as the project evolves.
