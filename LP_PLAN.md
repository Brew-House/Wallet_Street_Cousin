# $WSC Liquidity Plan

Wallet Street Cousin ($WSC) uses a **staged liquidity deployment** approach, designed to:
- Grow liquidity alongside community momentum
- Prevent thin pools and slippage traps
- Signal long-term intent and trust

---

## 💧 Target Allocation: 55% of Total Supply

A total of **55% of the 8.23B $WSC supply** is allocated to the Liquidity Pool.  
All LP deployments will be funded from the official **Liquidity Wallet**, listed in [`WALLETS.md`](./WALLETS.md).
5% of this allocation will be used for initial community airdrops (Liquidity Monsoon)

---

## 📊 LP Deployment Tranches

Liquidity is released in **8 tranches**, triggered as the community grows and volume justifies expansion.

## 🛡️ LP Lock Strategy

WSC is built on **transparency, not traps**.

- LP tokens may or may not be locked, depending on tactical flexibility needs.
- All actions will be explained and documented in this repo.
- If LP tokens are not locked, funds will remain in **Liquidity_Cold Wallet** with visible intent.

## 🔧 DEX of Record: BlazeSwap

Initial and ongoing LP will be seeded on [**BlazeSwap**](https://app.blazeswap.xyz/pool/) — Flare’s main community-led DEX.  
Additional pair listing incentivised across other Dex's

We may add:
- Real-time tracker (via Flare analytics or bot)
- Manual updates in this repo (e.g. LP size, FLR depth, $WSC in pool)
- Charts + links to DEX screener once active

## 🚫 No Surprise Injects or Pulls

Every LP movement will be:
