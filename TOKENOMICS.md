## Founder & Team Allocation

- No stealth wallets
- Disclosed and held transparently

This ensures that meme momentum is supported by long-term aligned stewards — not short-term dumpers.
**2.5% of this pledged to Community Faucets**
**Founder and Team may add to LP, but rewards are to be re-invested in pool**
**6-month vesting period (expires 2/3/26), after that sales tied to % of daily volume ala 'Taco Stand'**

Held in the main treasury wallet, used for:

- 🔥 Meme campaign support
- 📢 Marketing pushes
- 📈 liquidity provision
- 🧩 Community incentives

## No Tax. No Presale. No Burn.
**10% of this allocation will be used for the initial Monsoon Liquidity drop**
**1% of this allocation for Founder's 'Word of Mouth' drops - capped at 100 000 $WSC per person / wallet.**
**Remainin - 21.5% - rolling escrow 36 contracts**


$WSC is what it says it is — **meme-native**, **community-forward**, **liquidity-focused**, **and discerning**

There are no taxes on transfers. No deflation games. No inflated promises.  
The meme is the utility.
