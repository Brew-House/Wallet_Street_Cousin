# $WSC Liquidity Plan

Wallet Street Cousin ($WSC) uses a **staged liquidity deployment** approach, designed to:
- Grow liquidity alongside community momentum
- Prevent thin pools and slippage traps
- Signal long-term intent and trust

---

## 💧 Target Allocation: 55% of Total Supply

A total of **55% of the 8.23B $WSC supply** is allocated to the Liquidity Pool.  
All LP deployments will be funded from the official **Liquidity Wallet**, listed in [`WALLETS.md`](./WALLETS.md).

---

## 📊 LP Deployment Tranches

Liquidity is released in **8 tranches**, triggered as the community grows and volume justifies expansion.

| Tranche | % of Supply | Trigger Condition               |
|---------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| T1      | 12.5%       | Initial Launch LP               |
| T2      | 12.5%       | Volume or holders milestone     |
| T3      | 5%          | Community milestone / demand    |
| T4      | 5%          | Ecosystem listing or dev trigger|
| T5      | 5%          | Meme wave or engagement surge   |
| T6      | 5%          | Exchange listing or burn event  |
| T7      | 5%          | TBD - based on market signals   |
| T8      | 5%          | Final tranche - stabilization   |

## 🛡️ LP Lock Strategy

WSC is built on **transparency, not traps**.

- LP tokens may or may not be locked, depending on tactical flexibility needs.
- All actions will be explained and documented in this repo.
- If LP tokens are not locked, funds will remain in **Liquidity Wallet** with visible intent.

---

## 🔧 DEX of Record: SparkDEX

Initial and ongoing LP will be seeded on [**SparkDEX**](https://app.sparkdex.fi/) — Flare’s main DEX.  
Future pools (FLR/WSC, SGB/WSC, etc.) may be considered based on community votes.

---

## 🔎 LP Monitoring

We may add:
- Real-time tracker (via Flare analytics or bot)
- Manual updates in this repo (e.g. LP size, FLR depth, $WSC in pool)
- Charts + links to DEX screener once active

---

## 🚫 No Surprise Injects or Pulls

Every LP movement will be:
- Pre-announced
- Tracked via this repo
- Funded from public wallets

$WSC may be a meme — but our liquidity is serious.
