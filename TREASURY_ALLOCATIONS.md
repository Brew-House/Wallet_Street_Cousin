# $WSC Treasury Allocation

The Treasury holds **35% of the total $WSC supply** and is managed publicly via the [`Treasury Wallet`](./WALLETS.md).

These funds are reserved for ecosystem support, community growth, listings, and all the weird and wonderful things cousins may need as the project evolves.
